                            In the fall of 1966, Barbara and Samir
                            packed their bags and headed for Beirut,
                            intending to stay two years, before
                            returning to the states.  In reality, they
                            stayed 14 years, with occasional
                            sabbatical trips back to the US, two at
                            the University of Washington, and one at
                            University of Illinois.

                            In Lebanon, now with a second child, Sami,
                            Barbara also wanted to work.  Samir helped
                            her to obtain citizenship in Lebanon, and
                            from that point on she held dual
                            citizenship.  She busied herself with a
                            variety of work activities.  She taught in
                            the high school, she taught in the Beirut
                            College for Women, and she taught as a
                            faculty member at American University of
                            Beirut.  She also taught in the medical
                            school there, about the care of laboratory
                            animals.  After being granted citizenship,
                            she began to practice veterinary medicine
                            &amp; was the only veterinarian in Beirut
                            for the 14 years they lived there.She made
                            house calls to care for animals that were
                            sick or injured, in the homes of their
                            owners. She was involved in helping a
                            Beirut lady who rescued cats from around
                            the city.

                            In 1983, as the war in Lebanon raged ever
                            more and more fierce and dangerous, a
                            mortar shell hit and destroyed Samir's
                            laboratory. It was time to come back to
                            the US.
