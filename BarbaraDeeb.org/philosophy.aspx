                            In 1996, Barbara founded Allpet Veterinary
                            Clinic.  Finally, she could practice
                            veterinary medicine in the way she wanted
                            and in the setting she wanted.  Barbara
                            had high ideals.  She practiced with
                            kindness toward all of her animal
                            patients, she practiced with the integrity
                            of her professional convictions, and she
                            practiced with compassion toward the
                            devoted owners of the animals that were
                            brought to her for care.

                            She belonged to several organizations
                            including:

                            Society</a>; Barbara was a quintessential
                            practitioner of the society's philosophy.
                            While university scholarship and research
                            are important, objectivity and reason are
                            not necessarily the prime motivators of
                            human activity. It is vital, especially
                            when dealing with animal issues, also to
                            consider compassion and caring.

                            Barbara enjoyed bird watching and was a
                            member of the <a

                        <p>
                            She played golf and tennis. She studied
                            mushrooms and was an avid mushroom hunter
                            along with Samir.  She was a supporter and
                            contributor to a number of Environmental
                            Groups. She was a devoted wife, mother,
                            and grandmother.  She was a friend to
                            many.  She was a frequent consultant and
                            guest speaker to various animal interest
                            groups.

                            She contributed financially and
                            volunteered hours too numerous to count,
                            to the House Rabbit Society &amp; to <a

                            The one word people use over and over to
                            describe Barbara is compassionate. She was
                            compassionate towards humans and animals
                            alike.

                            When each grandchild was announced she was
                            as excited as if they were to be her own
                            children. She “forced” photos on everyone
                            who would hold still. She was such a proud
                            grandmother. She is survived by her
                            husband, Samir; A daughter, Lamya and her
                            husband, Russell Morgan, and their two
                            children, Perrin &amp; Drake; And by a
                            son, Sami and his wife, Marie, and their
