                        Even as a child, Barbara loved animals of all
                        kinds and stated that she wanted to grow up to
                        be a veterinarian, “a doctor for animals.”
                        Barbara went to elementary and high school in
                        Omaha.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it was time for Barbara to go to college,
                        she was committed to finding a school where
                        she could do her pre-veterinarian
                        pre-requisites&mdash;and then vet school.  She
                        chose Colorado State University in Fort
                        Collins, Colorado.  Her parents did not have
                        much money, but they were dedicated to her
                        support.  So, they moved to Fort Collins, as a
                        way of helping Barbara by continuing to
                        provide a home for her.  Barbara worked for a
                        year or two in an office, to save money toward
                        her tuition.  She was in the entering class of
                        1957, and in that same year she met a fellow
                        student from Beirut, Lebanon, Samir Deeb.  By
                        the time their first child, Lamya was born,
                        Barbara was a full time mom, and a half-time
                        student. Barbara hadn’t yet finished her
                        veterinarian degree when it was time for Samir
                        to move to Illinois. The University of
                        Illinois accepted her transfer (their first
                        female student) into their Veterinarian School
                        and gave her a scholarship.  It was there that
                        she obtained her degree in veterinary
                        medicine.

                        When Samir came to the University of
                        Washington for his fellowship, (1964-66)
                        Barbara entered the UW’s Masters degree
                        program in Preventive Medicine.
