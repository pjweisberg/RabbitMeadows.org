                        She was a compassionate veterinarian to her
                        patients and clients alike. From 1990 until
                        her death she volunteered her time to help
                        rabbits, rodents & ferrets at House Rabbit
                        Society, Rabbit Meadows Sanctuary & Best
                        Little Rabbit, Rodent & Ferret House. She
                        freely gave her time to educate caregivers of
                        these small animals at numerous workshops &
                        was a presenter at the first House Rabbit
                        Society Veterinary Conference. She spent long
                        hours on the phone in consultation with other
                        veterinarians across the country.

                        In 1996 she opened Allpet Veterinary Clinic in
                        Shoreline, WA. Many, many clients and their
                        companion animals were touched by her expert
                        veterinary care; her compassion towards them
                        and their pets; the numerous hours she spent
                        researching problems that she didn't
                        immediately know the answer to. Her clients
                        are forever grateful for having known her.

                        We hope that those of you who encounter this
                        page will follow in her footsteps, keeping her
                        memory, her passion and her compassion alive.
