    construction in a business park is defeated.</font></p>
    <p align="left">It has been exactly one year since the start of communications with Eddie
    Bauer (Redmond) to initiate the relocation of a large feral rabbit colony from the
    business park. Time was crucial. The lives of several hundred rabbits were in constant
    jeopardy because of construction and development at the site. In addition, the
    colony&#146;s population continued to increase fueled by people who disregarded &quot;no
    dumping/feeding&quot; signs and were observed feeding the rabbits nonessential
    &quot;junk&quot; foods (basic biology declares that the abundance of food allows for
    reproduction at a higher rate, dramatically increasing a species&#146; population). People
    were also observed dumping unwanted pet bunnies at the site.</td>

    <td width="50%" colspan="2" height="913">&nbsp;<p align="left">Despite what looked like a
    promising beginning to a huge project, HRS has found it to be a year of continuous
    resistance; refusal to accept responsibility; and finally, recognition that the goals of
    HRS were not compatible to those of Eddie Bauer, and therefore were unattainable.</p>
    <p align="left">HRS dealt with four entirely different volunteer groups since the start of
    the project. Each group claimed to represent Eddie Bauer, but yet presented an entirely
    contrasting agenda and focus as the previous group. By January, frustration was settling
    in as a retrospective view by HRS showed very little results for the amount of effort
    involved as only a little more than 100 rabbits were rescued after a nine month period.
    This prompted HRS to require Eddie Bauer&#146;s commitment in writing. Eddie Bauer agreed.
    &quot;It turned out that the joke was on us, as after two months of time wasted to prepare
    a document that everyone would agree on, Eddie Bauer would not sign the document, nor
    would they honor it,&quot; says Washington HRS President, Sandi Ackerman. &quot;It&#146;s
    obvious that our goal of relocating all rabbits was not the same as theirs.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">The four page &quot;Hare Transplant Project Agreement&quot; drawn-up by
    HRS and Eddie Bauer, stated its overall <font SIZE="3">mission as follows:
    &quot;Volunteers and businesses along the east side of 148th Avenue Northeast, between SR
    520 and Northeast 40th Street, will work together to humanely relocate all neighborhood
    feral rabbits in 1998.&quot; Specific responsibilities would be divided among HRS, Eddie
    Bauer, Redmond neighborhood volunteers, and King County Animal Control. However, Eddie
    Bauer would not sign the agreement, claiming they did not sign documents, but rather
    operated on a &quot;handshake,&quot; which&#151;to them&#151; was more valuable than a
    signature. The project was defeated two days later when an HRS rabbit was removed from the
    shelter in direct violation of the unsigned agreement. It became obvious that this piece
    of paper, without signatures, was worth exactly nothing, so HRS&#151;with much
    disappointment&#151;terminated the project. Eddie Bauer ordered HRS to &quot;take all HRS
    property out of shelter by Monday, March 23, 1998.&quot;</font></p>
    <font SIZE="3"><p align="left">Removing the property would not come easily. During a
    morning stop at the Eddie Bauer rabbit shelter to remove HRS property, Sandi Ackerman was
    stopped by Redmond Police officers crouched behind her van with guns drawn and pointed at
    her. An unknown employee at Eddie Bauer had called the police about &quot;three men who
    had broken the lock of the shelter and were in the process of loading their van with
    stolen property.&quot; After realizing the situation at hand did not coincide with the
    call, the Redmond Police officers thought they had arrived at the wrong location and left
    a traumatized Sandi to continue. They returned minutes later with the Eddie Bauer security
    officer who was not notified that Sandi and HRS were told to remove shelter property with
    only a few days notice. &quot;That final experience epitomized the whole frustrating year
    of dealing with Eddie Bauer and their lack of communication, commitment, and goals within
    their own company.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">An unknown number of rabbits remain in jeopardy at the site. Liver
    coccidia continues to kill the rabbits and to contaminate newly dumped rabbits. In
    addition to the continued construction, predators abound in the area. Sandi states,
    &quot;I left the shelter after midnight one night and stood silently as a coyote stared
    brazenly back at me. Hawks pickup rabbits to about 20 feet then drop them, they do this
    over and over until the animal is stunned or dead. There is plenty of food for these
    predators living right in the middle of a busy business park. I don&#146;t object to these
    wild animals finding food for themselves, but they should be finding wild food, not
    domestic rabbits to feast upon.&quot;</font></p>
    <font SIZE="3"><p align="left">In the last written communication to Eddie Bauer, Sandi
    Ackerman stated: &quot;HRS has done everything that was promised (and that we put into
    writing and <i>signed</i>) to the point that Eddie Bauer would renege and instruct us to
    halt everything.&quot; Sadly, it is the rabbits who will continue to suffer. </font><font
