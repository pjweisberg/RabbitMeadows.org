Barbara Deeb our dear friend, supporter of our shelter and compassionate
caregiver for many of your companion animals left us.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Terry and Jennie Savery
wrote:</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We expect she is in
heaven, and that some of those angel wings are actually rabbit ears,
misperceived for centuries, due no doubt to the distances, the blue sky and
white fleecy clouds of the setting.</span></i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know that Dr. Deeb appreciates this sentiment and is
smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I first met Dr. Deeb about 16 years ago, after reading an article
she wrote about using pain meds to help rabbits. It’s hard to imagine, now in
2005, that 16 years ago pain meds were not commonly used. Of course 16 years
ago, rabbits were not commonly spayed or neutered either and their lives were
much shorter than their current 8-10+ years. Dr. Deeb helped greatly to
increase our companion’s longevity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before the Internet became so active, she became the primary
contributing editor to <i>Rabbit Health News for Veterinarians</i>. With Dr.
Deeb’s help, articles and energy, we published this newsletter from 1990 – 1995
successfully getting information about rabbit medicine to veterinarians across the
country. Then because of <i>Rabbit Health News</i>, Dr. Deeb would spend hours
answering questions from other veterinarians across the country (including veterinarians
in Singapore &amp; Canada) who had read of her work with rabbits. Back then, she
was one of only a handful of veterinarians across the US who loved rabbits and who
was spending her own time learning about them in order to help them to live to
their full life potential.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>First known to us rabbit lovers for her research on <i>Pasteurella 
multocida</i>. Because of her work, rabbits who used to be routinely euthanized
or allowed to die untreated, can now survive for years on antibiotics which can
control this bacteria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Founded Sound Diagnostics Lab in 1996. This lab tests for <i>Pasteurella
multocida</i>, <i>E. cuniculi</i>, rabbit syphillis &amp; tyzzers and supplies
test results to veterinarians across the US helping them to correctly diagnose
these diseases.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Spoke at the House Rabbit Society Veterinary Conference in 1997. Presented
numerous papers on ferret &amp; rabbit medicine at a variety of other veterinary
conferences and was looking forward to speaking at ICE (International
Conference on Exotics) at the end of this month.</p>

ferrets. The latest was the current edition of <i><span style='color:black'>Ferrets,
