	This file allows users to post files to their web with the Web Publishing Wizard or FrontPad, using the same username and password they would
	use if they were authoring with the FrontPage Explorer and Editor.
	The values below are automatically set by FrontPage at installation
	time.  Normally, you do not need to modify these values, but in case
	you do, the parameters are as follows:
	'BaseURL' is the URL for your web server.
	
	'DefaultPage' is the name of the default (home) page name 
	for your web.
	'XferType' specifies that the FrontPage server extensions have been
	installed on this web.  This value should not be changed.
	'FPShtmlScriptUrl', 'FPAuthorScriptUrl', and 'FPAdminScriptUrl' specify
	the relative urls for the scripts that FrontPage uses for remote
	authoring.  These values should not be changed.
	'version' identifies the version of the format of this file, and
	should not be changed.--><!-- WebPost
