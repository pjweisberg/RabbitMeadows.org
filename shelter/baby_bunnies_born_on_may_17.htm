<p><strong>Today is January 16, 2001. As incredible as it is, Mom's been with us for 9
months now.&nbsp; We've been using a high dose of the same medicine to fight this
insidious raccoon round worm as we use to battle E.cuniculi...and it's working! So far
it's bought her at least an extra 6 months of life...and she's enjoying every minute. <font
size="2">With donations from friends of mom, we just bought her this wheelchair from
Doggon Wheels and she loves it! It keeps her upright and she's learning to manuever around
the shelter. In the last photo, I swear you can see her smiling. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">Nine of Mom's babies have been adopted (all were quite healthy).
The two boys are now nine months old. They are sweet, mischevious, adorable and need a
home of their own. So if you need a boy friend for your female rabbit come visit us at the
Best Little Rabbit, Rodent &amp; Ferret House in Seattle to meet these two.</font></strong></p>

<p><u><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Baby bunnies born on May 17, 2000. </font></strong></u></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">I spent day one and two contemplating how I was ever going to
afford to spay and neuter all of these bunnies. Six spay surgeries x $85 = $510 and five
neuter surgeries x $65 = $325. Wow! a total of $835.00!&nbsp; People who say they are
going to have &quot;just one litter&quot; don't understand that unless they do spay and
neuter, they will be responsible for way more than &quot;just one litter.&quot;&nbsp; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">And then these same people don't usually stop to think that for
every bunny they breed, one will die at a shelter. If their friends and relatives really
want rabbits, they should head straight for their local shelter or rescue group to adopt
and save a rabbit from being killed.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">I finally got over my financial shock to realize that this might
be an opportunity to share the rapid growth of bunnies with the internet community.
Perhaps by sharing in the life of this litter, it won't be necessary for someone to
produce more unwanted rabbits. In eight weeks we're going to be looking for homes for
these 11 rabbits and we still have one rabbit looking for a home from a litter we took in
last July 1999 and there are two rabbits from a litter we took in August 1999. These now
adult rabbits, were once cute adorable bunnies like the ones you are about to see, but now
they're adults just sitting in our shelter waiting for their very own home. You can visit
them on our adoption page after you oooh and aaaaw over these cute bunnies.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">Proud Mom. We rescued her from a local animal shelter and she
had her babies that same night. Mom was found abandoned in a local park. She is being a
terrific Mom, taking very good care of this extra large litter. The really sad thing is
that Mom is infected with the raccoon round worm and we are hoping she will live long
enough to get these babies off to a good start. The raccoon round worm gets into the
rabbits brain and travels throughout until various life functions no longer work. This is
an extremely common (and always deadly) situation for dumped rabbits.&nbsp; If any of the
bunnies are infected they will either show symptoms or die before they are 8 weeks old.
(The odds are against their being infected so we're keeping our fingers crossed.)</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">Newborn bunnies can be easily sexed before they have too much
hair. If you look closely, you can see the rows of nipples down each side. (Male rabbits
may have one or two nipples but they are never fully developed.) Once the babies are fully
furred you can no longer see their nipples, or lack thereof and they become more difficult
to accurately sex until they are 6-8 weeks old.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">I know that many people recommend against feeding baby bunnies
veggies until they are three to six months old. I've never understood this. Their mom is
eating veggies, so they will also get veggies in their milk. Unless you separate them from
their mom they naturally munch on whatever veggies she is eating. I've never experienced
baby bunnies getting diarrhea from eating veggies, but if the day comes when I do, *then*
I'll stop and slowly introduce one veggie at a time to him. But until that day comes, all
of the other baby bunnies won't be deprived of enjoying their veggies. &nbsp; (I keep
looking for the pellet feeders hanging on the trees in the forest, but so far I haven't
found any. :-)&nbsp; </font></strong></p>

5' long by 2 1/2' wide, when the kids started doing bunny dances they were bashing into
one another. It's been amazing how rapidly they have grown out of each of their houses and
it really emphasizes how ridiculous those &quot;starter homes&quot; are that most pet
stores sell. The poor bunnies end up living in a house that was designed for a 3 week old
until they are 6 months old, or sadly, sometimes all of their lives.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Our 3 foster homes will only keep their two bunnies for the next
2 - 3 weeks. Sadly, Mom is rapidly worse each day and falls every few steps. She's having
more and more trouble getting back on her feet and I fear that it will only be a few more
days until she'll no longer be able to get up again.&nbsp; Because of the rapid
deterioration we're trying a medication that will penetrate into the brain, but we don't
know if it's strong enough to kill the parasite. At this point we have nothing to lose by
trying to stop this deadly parasite. We've taken blood to check kidney &amp; liver
functions prior to starting and if by any chance this works to even slow the parasite,
we'll be able to check organ functions again after the medication is stopped to see if it
might lead to a treatment for this nasty bug. We will keep you all posted.</strong></font></p>
