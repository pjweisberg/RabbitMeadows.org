    hard to ignore, especially when your bun sits up and looks so deserving of that special
    treat. And pet stores sell a selection of rabbit treats which are perfect for your
    precious rabbit. Right? WRONG!!! Most so-called rabbit treats are the equivalent of taking
    your rabbit to McDonald</font><font SIZE="3">&#146;s, providing non-nutritious junk that
    can cause potential harm to your rabbit. Confusing the issue is that many of these
    products use phrases that lead the buyer to believe that the product is healthful:
    &quot;nutritionally fortified,&quot; &quot;doing right for the environment,&quot;
    &quot;natural feeding habits,&quot; &quot;for nutritional variety,&quot; &quot;the finest
    selected ingredients.&quot; The addition of &quot;feeding instructions&quot; and
    &quot;guaranteed analysis&quot; lend a cache of authority. Commercial rabbit treats fall
    into several categories: pellets, processed cereal kibble, mueslix (dried
    seed/fruit/veggie mixes), cereal/veggie blends, and candies/sugars. None confer an
    advantage over the fresh vegetable, high fiber pellets, and unlimited hay diet.</p>
    <p>Pellets were discussed in the <i>House Rabbit Journal</i>, vol. 111, #4. I won&#146;t
    say more here except to repeat those guidelines: choose a pellet that is high in fiber
    (20-25%) and low in protein (14-15%) and calcium (&lt;1.0%). Restrict pellet feedings to
    HRS guidelines and feed plenty of fresh vegetables and unlimited hay. Do not buy a pellet
    that contains seeds, nuts, or starch-rich cereal kibble mixed in (see below).</p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF">Processed Cereal Kibble.</font> </b>These range from &quot;Crunch
    Puffs&quot; to shaped products designed to substitute for pellets. Some contain expensive
    extras that serve no benefit to your rabbit, such as plant or herbal extracts and freeze
    dried bacteria. One contains less than the National Research Council (NRC) requirements
    for calcium. Another contains cheese flavoring! Supplementation with digestive enzymes
    (proteases, amylases) normally is unecessary because these foods are highly digestible and
    because there is no evidence that healthy rabbits produce insufficient levels of these
    enzymes; in fact, some of the most important digestion is by the cecal bacteria. These
    kibbles tend to be lower in fiber and higher in fat. They are also extremely expensive and
    come with feeding recommendations destined to give a spayed or neutered </font><font
    SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">house rabbit obesity. The variety of colors and shapes are more
    of an aesthetic to the human buyer than to your rabbit. Again, fresh vegetables,
    restricted high fiber pellets, and unlimited hay are healthier and easier on your budget. </font></p>
    <font SIZE="3"><b><p><font color="#0000FF">Mueslix.</font> </b>These are mixes which are
    made of seeds and grains. They are marketed as &quot;vitamin and mineral enriched,&quot; a
    delicious &quot;energy provider,&quot; or &quot;fortified.&quot; They are made of
    carbohydrate and fat-rich seeds and grains such as oats, milo, corn, peas, sunflower
    seeds, potatoes, peanuts, puffed corn, cornflakes, popcorn, and dried fruits. They are
    often held together into &quot;sticks&quot; with honey and other sugars, and are marketed
    with the explanation that they supply needed energy and reflect the rabbit's normal diet. </p>
    <p>In reality, a diet of vegetables, hay and restricted pellets provides all the nutrients
    and energy your house rabbit needs. Seeds are high in fat and are important for wintering
    animals. Your house rabbit has no such need; in fact, the National Research Council
    recommends that domestic rabbits receive no more than 1.5% of their calories as fat.
    Labels on the back of these mueslix products list a minimum fat content of 4-5%; the real
    value is probably greater. Rabbit metabolism is geared for a low fat diet (in comparison,
    the average human diet contains 35-40% fat!), and the excess is not burned but is stored
    as body fat. Rabbits appear to be more sensitive to fat than are humans, and in addition
    to obesity, the excess fat can accumulate in your rabbit's liver and arteries
    (atherosclerosis). Veterinarians have reported that rabbits fed seed-rich diets have a
    much higher incidence of fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis), which is often fatal.</p>
    <p>These seeds and grains are also rich in starches. While some of this starch is digested
    in small intestine, much of it is not accessible until it reaches the cecum. There it
    becomes a potent energy form for the cecal bacteria. Unlike cellulose fiber, which slows
    fermentation, starch in the cecum is fermented rapidly and can lead to bacterial
    overgrowth, bloat, and GI stasis.</p>
    <p>Manufacturers claim that seeds and grains satisfy &quot;the </font><font SIZE="3"
    COLOR="#000000">chewing urge.&quot; While this is true, it is far safer and cheaper to
    satisfy that urge with baskets, untreated wood, and cardbaord boxes.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="3"><b><p><font color="#0000FF">Cereal/Veggie Blends.</font> </b>These are
    grain products which may be supplemented with dehydrated vegetables, and shaped into a
    form which mimics a vegetable product. There is no advantage to feeding these over the
    real vegetable. One product label lists three different cereals before the dehydrated
    vegetable! The high carbohydrate content of these snacks means they are robbing your
    rabbit of important fiber and overloading him with sugars. These products also tout the
    vitamins that are added back (due to processing); real vegetables will supply as much if
    not more. With 2.1 ounces costing $3.09 ($24 per pound), a pound of carrots and some
    cardboard provides a healthier and cheaper alternative.</p>
    <b><p><font color="#0000FF">Candies/Sugars.</font> </b>These can include everything from
    yogurt drops to sweetened papaya tablets. The high sugar is the culprit here. Many rabbits
    have a sweet tooth, but sweetness means a high content of sugars. As we discussed above,
    excessive sugar is converted to fat, or will pass into the cecum where the bacteria will
    use it for energy and then rapidly overgor, possibly leading to bacterial imbalance and GI
    stasis. The same can occur after feeding too much fruit. Avoid feeding your rabbit simple
    sugars and instead stick with nutritious treats such as vegetables and herbs; save the
    sweets for an occasional raisin or banana snack.</p>
    <b><p><font color="#0000FF">Vitamin Supplements.</font> </b>These are largely unnecessary.
    For nearly all rabbits, a diet containing a variety of fresh vegetables, restricted high
    quality pellets, and unlimited hay provides all the vitamins your rabbit requires; many of
    your rabbit's vitamins come from her normal ingestion of cecal pellets. While special
    health situations may require nutrient supplements, these are best handled after
    consultation with your veterinarian.</p>
    <p>It is tempting to show your love for your rabbit by purchasing treats for her. If you
    are in doubt, read the ingredient label; pay particular attention to the list of
    ingredients (they are listed in order of abundance) and the percentage of fiber and fat.
    Speaking as a nutritionist, my best advice is to save your money and show your love with
    healthy treats like vegetables, hay and untreated wood for chewing. And give plenty of
    pets, which are, of course, free. </font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="3">v</font><font
