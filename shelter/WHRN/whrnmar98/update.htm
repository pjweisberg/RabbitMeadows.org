      </font><font SIZE="3">IMPORTANT UPDATE ON THE USE OF <i>FRONTLINE </i>IN RABBITS</font></b></p>
      <font SIZE="3"><p>Since my last article on flea control in rabbits, it has come to my
      attention that there have been a number of deaths of rabbits apparently associated with
      the use of <i>FRONTLINE </i>(fipronil&#151;produced by Rhone Merieux Companion Animal
      Products). These deaths have been reported by veterinary practitioners across the country.
      As I mentioned in my article in the last issue of <i>Chicago House Rabbit News </i>[reprinted
      in the September issue of <i>Washington House Rabbit News</i>], the company that produces
      this product does NOT authorize or condone its use in rabbits, therefore they cannot be
      held liable. With this new information in hand, I recommend NOT using <i>Frontline</i> in
      rabbits for any reason. There are other, safer alternatives available.</p>
      <i><p>Editor's Note: Several severe cases of enteritis have occurred as a result of
      rabbits ingesting ADVANTAGE FLEA CONTROL while grooming their companions. If you use this
      product and have multiple rabbits in your household, please separate your rabbits for 12
      hours after application.</i></font></p>
      <font SIZE="3"><b><p align="center">A DELICATE SUBJECT</b></p>
      <p>I would like to discuss a delicate but important subject in this issue. This is a
      subject that we would rather not even think about, but without this important diagnostic
      tool, our knowledge of rabbit medicine (as well as knowledge of medicine in all species of
      animals including man) would be sorely lacking. The subject is the importance of a
      postmortem, or examination of a patient&#146;s body after death. </p>
      <p>Death is an inevitable part of our experience here. I will not attempt to discuss the
      various philosophies associated with this phenomenon, but its existence is part of the
      normal cycle of nature. Whether you believe there is a rebirth after death or whether you
      believe it is an end, we cannot prevent it for ourselves or our pets. Unfortunately,
      western society spends a great deal of time avoiding the subject, pretending it won&#146;t
      happen and taking desperate measures to try and stave it off, rather than accepting death
      as natural. Death brings with it an end, of course, a sadness and certainly grief, but it
      can also bring great relief from suffering, peacefulness and great knowledge. </font></p>
      <font SIZE="3"><p>The knowledge can come from what we learned from that being&#146;s
      spiritual and physical existence here, lessons such as love, forgiveness, laughter and
      letting go.</p>
      <p>We also can learn valuable lessons from that being&#146;s physical body, such as cause
      of disease, effectiveness of therapy, effects of diet, environment and genetics&#151;to
      name a few. Some of you will have spiritual beliefs that do not allow the physical body to
      be altered after death, which we can respect. But for those who do not have these beliefs,
      for those who believe the spirit leaves the body after death or that death is the end,
      then there is no harm in allowing that dear pet to teach us yet one last lesson, the
      lesson that only examination of the physical body can reveal.</p>
      <p>The correct name for the examination of the physical body is a postmortem,
      &quot;post&quot; meaning &quot;after&quot; and &quot;mortem&quot; meaning
      &quot;death&quot;. The term &quot;autopsy&quot; is used only for humans because
      &quot;auto&quot; means self and only refers to humans doing postmortems on the same
      species (self) which are other humans. Postmortems have been performed for thousands of
      years, primarily to determine the cause of death of the person or animal. Much of our
      medical knowledge comes from these examinations. Without postmortems, we would probably be
      hundreds of years behind in our ability to detect and manage disease. Therefore, the
      postmortem is vitally important to the future health and welfare of any species in
      question. </p>
      <p>When should postmortems be performed? In order to gain the most useful information, a
      postmortem should be performed within 48 hours of death. It is particularly important to
      keep the deceased pet cool during this time. If the pet is kept at 70 F or higher then
      decomposition will be rapid and 48 hours may be too long. In general, it is best to get
      the pet to the veterinarian as soon as possible after death and to keep the body cool
      (below 60 if possible), but NOT frozen. If the tissues freeze, the damage caused by the
      ice crystals can make it impossible to make a diagnosis from a microscopic examination.</p>
      <p>What actually happens during a postmortem of a rabbit? There are a couple of ways that
      it can be approached. In some cases, only one feature of the pet will be examined, say an
      eye, or the heart because that is where the problem was most prominent. However, most
      often the entire animal will be examined because we have found over the years that
      sometimes what is obvious during life is masking other disease that is only discovered
      after death. To get the whole or &quot;holistic&quot; picture, it is best to look at all
      the organ systems. To do this, it is necessary to make an incision usually from the neck
      to the tail (like a very long surgical incision) on the underside in order to be able to
      open up the body cavities and take a look. First everything is viewed in place and then
      the organs are examined separately. The cause of disease may be obvious to the naked eye,
      but sometimes it is necessary to take small samples of tissue and send them to a
      pathologist for a microscopic examination for a more complete diagnosis. The samples are
      usually small and can include just about any organ in the body including blood, intestinal
      contents and bone. Cultures can be taken from a variety of tissues to test for bacterial
      infection. Impression smears (a glass slide is placed on the surface of the tissue lightly
      and then the cells that cling to the slide are looked at under the microscope) can provide
      a quick evaluation of the health of a variety of organs. If the rabbit was exhibiting
      disease in the brain, it may be necessary to make an additional incision in the skull and
      take tissue samples. Since the incision is surgical in nature, it is possible for the
      veterinarian to sew up the wound after the postmortem is completed. If you would prefer
      that this is done with your pet, please discuss this with your veterinarian. This is
      referred to as a &quot;cosmetic postmortem&quot; which returns the animal&#146;s physical
      body to as normal a state as possible.</font><img src="wpe2.jpg"

      <font SIZE="3"><p>Why should you have a postmortem done? After all, it won&#146;t bring
      the pet back to life, so what is the point? The following are some of the important
      reasons to consider a postmortem on your pet:</p>
      <p>1. If you have a multi-pet household, particularly if you have several rabbits, <b>a
      postmortem may reveal disease that could potentially spread to others in the household. </b>If
      disease is diagnosed through postmortem, then preventative measures can be taken. I can
      tell you that postmortems have saved literally hundreds of animals&#146; lives in our
      practice over the years because of the knowledge obtained when one of their cage mates
      died revealed a serious group problem.</p>
      <p>2. <b>A postmortem can reveal potential zoonotic disease (disease transmissible from
      animals to man) that could be problem for human members of the household,</b> particularly
      those with immune suppressant diseases. Common examples of exotic animal zoonotic diseases
      are salmonellosis, psittacosis (parrot fever) and certain parasites. Although rabbits are
      not commonly carriers of salmonella and zoonotic parasites, they can exist and cause
      problems. </font></p>
      <font SIZE="3"><p>3. <b>A postmortem can reveal the cause of death when it comes as a
      surprise. </b>When a pet dies suddenly and unexpectedly, often we blame ourselves for
      negligence or oversight. This, more often than not, is untrue. Without a postmortem, we
      may never know what happened and not only will we continue to torture ourselves with
      second guesses, we will have no available information on any possible prevention with
      future pets (if there is a way to prevent it). We cannot completely CONTROL when an animal
      passes from this existence; it is going to happen eventually. We can however, try to
      understand when and IF we had any effect on the event. It is often a relief for our
      clients to know that the death was NOT something that they could alter or prevent in any
      way.</p>
      <p>4. <b>A postmortem can reveal the success or failure of certain treatment regimens. </b>Without
      this feedback, we cannot know for sure if treatments that we use&#151;including
      medications, diets and surgeries&#151;are effective. With information from a postmortem,
      we can make improved therapeutic choices in the future. </p>
      <p>5. <b>A postmortem can reveal genetic, environmental and dietary problems. </b>With
      knowledge of genetic problems we can hopefully stop breeding from such defects. With
      knowledge of environmental and dietary disease we can improve those areas. We have learned
      a great deal, for instance, about appropriate diets in rabbits from close examination of
      the rabbits who succumbed to poor diets we fed in the past. We can thank those early
      rabbits who passed on and the veterinarians that examined them for the improved health and
      longevity of our pets today related to improved diets.</p>
      <p>So what is this going to cost? Postmortems can have a wide range of costs depending on
      the practice and what is accomplished during the examination. Some veterinarians offer
      postmortems free of charge only if it involves a patient who was under treatment at that
      hospital at the time of death. Others have specific costs involved depending on the
      size/species of patient or the extent of the postmortem. All veterinarians will charge for
      the pathologists&#146;s fees if samples are sent in for microscopic examination because
      the pathologist is charging the veterinarian for that fee in addition to packaging the
      tissues, mailing them in and the time involved in interpreting the results.</font></p>
      <font SIZE="3"><p>In conclusion, a postmortem examination can be an extremely useful tool
      in continuing our quest for knowledge on the improvement of health in the rabbit. Discuss
      this issue with your veterinarian. Often veterinarians are hesitant to bring up the
      subject because it is so difficult to think about it at such a painful time. If you
      initiate the conversation, it will put the veterinarian at ease and allow for an
      intelligent discussion of whether or not a postmortem will be valuable in your pet&#146;s
      case. Try to think about this subject and come to a feeling about it BEFORE the time
      comes, so you are comfortable with your decision. If you are not comfortable with a
      postmortem at any time, or with certain pets, your veterinarian will respect your decision
      and it will not be necessary to explain your position. This was your friend in life and it
      is ultimately your decision as to what happens after death.</p>
      <p>Finally, on a more cheerful note, I would really appreciate it if you, the rabbit
      owning public who read these articles, would send me ideas on things you want to hear
      about! This publication is for you and we serve you best if we know what you want. Thanks
      for reading about and considering this difficult subject.</p>
