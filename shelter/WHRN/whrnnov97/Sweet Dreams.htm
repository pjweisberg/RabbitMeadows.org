    <p>I have a very sad footnote to the photo published in the September 97 issue taken of
    Bubba and Sarah. We lost Sarah on August 28th from complications arising from pneumonia. I
    would like to remind house bunny people to please be observant of your buns behavior and
    to take action immediately if it changes. Don't allow out of town guests, work schedules,
    or other &quot;pressing&quot; things to distract you from getting your bun to the vet.
    Also, please only use HRS approved vets. They are recommended for good reasons. I can't
    express how completely heartbroken I feel about losing Sarah. Especially to something that
    could have very well been nipped in the bud had I followed this advice. </p>
    <p>Sarah came to us from the Burlington Animal Shelter about 3 weeks after Easter in 1996.
    She gave Bubba (who came to us a week after Easter 1995 after being found on an
    undeveloped golf course) lots of companionship and </p>
    <p>constant grooming. It breaks my heart to see him sitting alone on the couch. I believe
    her pneumonia developed from hot weather stress. She was always kept inside the house with
    fans and frozen water bottles, but she still fell ill. She was responding so well to the
    medication I truely felt she would make a full recovery. One week into treatment and I
    came home to find her barely alive. She passed away at the Emerald City Emergency Clinic.
    Bubba has tested negative to any infection, but is hurting from the loss of his beloved
    friend. </p>
    <p>We miss Sarah terribly. Please learn from our heartbreak and get approved veterinarian
    advice for any problem you notice. Even if it turns out to be nothing, you will at least
    have peace of mind that you took the right action to protect your bun. </p>
    <p>We hope that Sarah is now comfortable and is happily bounding through the bunny fields
    with our Mr. Buns on the otherside of the Rainbow Bridge. Please take care and give your
    buns an extra hug today in memory of Sarah. </p>
    <p>Bubba, Wendy &amp; Shane Mauch </td>
