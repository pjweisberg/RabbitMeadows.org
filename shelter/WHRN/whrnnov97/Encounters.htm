Encounters<br>
of the Furred Kind</b> </h2>

<p><i>By: Kristi Cole</i> </p>

<p>Thinking about a friend for your rabbit? Adding another rabbit to your household can
result in greater long term joy for both you and your current rabbit with some up-front
effort and minimal upkeep. </p>

<p><b>Why Try?</b> </p>

<p>Rabbits are social creatures and need some type of interaction. Boredom can lead to
withdrawal or the opposite, destructiveness, in our house rabbits. Our domestic rabbits
are descendants of the European wild rabbits, who live in large colonies. Some of that
needed interaction may be with you directly, but what if you're gone a lot? Rabbits in
groups keep each other company during times when the humans can't be present, yet groups
also enjoy human companionship when they interact on that level. </p>

<p>After many years of having single bunnies, we learned about the need for socialization
and decided to try a pair. What a wonderful sight to behold. There's nothing like watching
a furry couple interact and to observe the subtleties of their communication. They groom
each other and relax next to each other. They chew on opposite ends of the same carrot. </p>

<p>There is little difference between caring for a bonded pair and caring for a single
rabbit. They share living space, exercise time, and litterboxes. An increase in food and
litter cost is minimal. The biggest difference would be in medical care. </p>

<p><b>Formula for a Hare Pair</b> </p>

<p>It is best to start with rabbits who have already been spayed or neutered. This
minimizes the horrmonal aspect of the bonding. It is said that the easiest pair to bond is
a male/female couple. However, in many instances, there has been successful bonding of
same-sex pairs. It may just take a little longer. </p>

<p>First let the rabbits be in the same room together but in separate enclosures so they
can't come in direct contact for several days. This will allow them to get familiar with
scents and sounds of the other rabbit before the face to face bonding. Another way to get
them comfortable with each other's scents and sounds is to switch living areas. For
instance, if one bunny is in the cage for 12 hours and the other is out in the rest of the
room, the next 12 hours put the second bunny in the cage and let the first one roam. This
way they are sharing territories but at separate times. </p>

<p>Rabbits are territorial by nature and feel the need to defend their territory. The goal
is to get their guard down enough to accept a new friend. To get their guard down, it is
best to find a neutral territory; that is, one that is different from your rabbit's
current area. </p>

<p>It is also helpful to introduce some mild stress into the situation, so they are
distracted from the need to defend their space. Some examples are: a ride in the backseat
of the car&#151;a neutral area that cause them to snuggle for reassurance rather than
fight, or a visit to the bathtub (dry, of course!)&#151;again neutral, close quarters that
may be slippery and entice cuddling. You want to keep it limited to a small space so they
are forced to interact, not go exploring on their own. </p>

<p>With our first bonding attempt, we decided the thing to do was to take it very slowly
and start with the rides in the back seat of the car. This made them just scared enough
not to fight and allowed them to huddle together and get used to each other's smells and
touch. The first week, we took them on 20 minute car rides every night. My husband drove
and I sat in the back seat with the bunnies and the litter box. After the car rides, we
put them back in their separate areas. </p>

<p>During week two, we did some car rides and then proceeded to a neutral bathroom
afterwards. This was small space and it forced the rabbits to interact while supervised.
After several days when they seemed comfortable with each other, we proceeded to let them
out in a larger, more permanent area&#151;still supervised. Eventually, when they snuggled
a lot and groomed one another quite a bit and there were no more minor scuffles, we felt
it was okay for them to be together 24 hours a day. </p>

<p>This method has worked well for us several times now. Be consistent at your efforts.
Keep a squirt bottle handy to break up scuffles. This will often distract them enough to
start grooming themselves and stop squabbling. If they mount and/or chase each other, stay
close, but don't interfere unless it gets too rough. This is part of their way of working
out the dominance issue. </p>

<p>With a little time and patience, the rewards for you and your current companion rabbit
can be great by adding another bunny to the family. The methods above can also be used in
making a trio or bonding two pairs. You will be gratified to watch them interact and they
will be more satisfied with life, sharing it both with a human friend and a fellow rabbit.
