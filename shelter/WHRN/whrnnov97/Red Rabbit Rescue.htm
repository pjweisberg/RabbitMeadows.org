    <p>The Consequences of Years of Rabbit Dumping </p>
    <p><i>By Jill Tamane</i> </p>
    <p><b>In the midst of recent publicity surrounding the Redmond feral rabbit controversy,
    lies a significant issue that went virtually ignored by the media. It is a concern that
    the House Rabbit Society has voiced loudly since its inception: place unwanted pet bunnies
    into another home, refrain from dumping rabbits into &quot;natural settings.&quot;</b> </p>
    <p>For the last few decades what is currently a business park in the city of Redmond, has
    continued to be a well-known area for dumping pet bunnies. Property owners originally
    encouraged dumping on the site as they considered the abundance of rabbits to be an
    attraction. HRS saw it differently and offered to neuter/spay the rabbits then re-release
    them onto the site. The park's businesses turned down all offers by HRS. </p>
    <p>Against nature's odds and in spite of continued development in the business park, the
    colony's population grew (fueled by regular feeding by employees and visitors). Rabbits
    were forced to seek other living areas as the site decreased in size due to continued
    construction. The rabbits were crowded onto the highways that bordered a segment of the
    park. During a recent land clearing on the site, a local traffic report announced a
    caution to drivers as a large number of rabbits were running around the busy highway in
    the area. Dead rabbits are an increasingly common sight on the roadside near the Redmond
    business park. <img SRC="whrndHE1.JPG" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="155" align="left"></p>
    <p>In April of this year, a tenant of the property contacted HRS citing that the rabbits
    had eaten thousands of dollars worth of landscaping, and they wanted to rid the property
    of rabbits. By October 19, 1997, &quot;Hare Transplant Operation&quot; was <font size="3">underway
    with the enormous task of rescuing the rabbits and eventually relocating or adopting them
    to good homes. HRS,&nbsp; Rabbit Haven, and caring veterinarians (all donating their time)
    rescued 49 rabbits during the initial roundup (763 was the final count). </font></p>
    <p>Upon reporting about the rescue operation, a local newspaper stated that &quot;hundreds
    of rabbits . . . were killed recently as a result of . . . work at a construction site. .
    . .&quot; The article barely mentioned the deaths of thousands of rabbits that began
    decades before the recent construction work because of owners dumping their unspayed and
    unneutered rabbits. </p>
    <p>Releasing a pet bunny into a &quot;natural setting&quot; is equivalent to giving it a
    death sentence. Thousands of death sentences were carried out over the last 20 or 30
    years. </p>
    <p>Dumped pet bunnies cannot live as feral rabbits do. Feral rabbits have lived without
    human contact <img SRC="whrndHE3.JPG" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="161" align="left">for many
    generations. They are acclimated to the outdoors and attuned to the sights, smells, and
    sounds of the environment. Feral rabbit colonies do not accept domestic rabbit newcomers
    into their social group very easily. A rescued bunny from the Redmond site was dumped very
    recently. The sweet Netherland Dwarf shows evidence of a battle resulting in one blind
    eye. Parasites, such as a lethal liver coccidia and other diseases are often widespread
    among the feral colony members. The result is a colony with very few members older than
    one year old. </p>
    <p>Domestic rabbits are acclimated to living in a home. They rely on their owners for food
    and affection. They are accustomed to human interaction and lack the ability to recognize
    the dangers of the outdoors. In the winter months when food sources are scarce, domestic
    bunnies are easily spotted by hungry predators on the site. Business park employees have
    reported hawks and coyotes carrying off rabbits on a daily basis. The &quot;natural
    setting&quot; is foreign to a domestic bunny, as they are known to stay in the same area
    they were originally dropped off and rarely wander far from it. </p>
    <p>Presently, the Redmond feral rabbit colony contains well over 500 rabbits that remain
    on the business park grounds. </p>
    <p>The task of rescuing what has resulted over the last three decades is a major one. It
    will require hundreds of volunteers and veterinarians to rescue, spay/neuter, medicate,
    and relocate the rabbits. It is anticipated that the rescue project may take up to one
    year. <img SRC="whrndHE2.JPG" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="174" align="right"></p>
    <p>Money is extremely limited. Bills for supplies and veterinary expenses have yet to be
    paid. Costs are estimated at $60 per rabbit for spay/neuter operations, food, medication,
    and other veterinary expenses. HRS is depending upon fund raising and donations to cover
    most of the costs. </p>
    <p>The House Rabbit Society discourages anyone from attempting to rescue these rabbits on
    their own. &quot;Well-meaning individuals are `rescuing' rabbits at night, not knowing
    that they are taking the deadly coccidia to any other rabbits they have at home,&quot;
    says Sandi Ackerman, Washington HRS Chapter Manager. </p>
    <p>Sending negative messages to the companies involved are discouraged by HRS as the
    project has turned precarious following the negative publicity presented by the media.
    &quot;Every threatening phone call and email message they receive causes more
    hostility,&quot; explained Sandi. &quot;Project negotiations are currently ongoing with
    the companies and these negative contacts are detrimental. &quot; </p>
    <p><img SRC="whrndHE4.JPG" WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="173" align="left">HRS picked up 49 rabbits
    from the site on October 19 and currently most are healthy enough to be removed from
    quarantine. We anticipate picking up approximately 50 rabbits every day that we trap. As
    of November 12, 63% of the rabbits tested positive for liver coccidia. Following three and
    a half weeks of medication, all but one have tested negative for all parasites. Thirteen
    rabbits were successfully spayed, 12 rabbits were successfully neutered, and one rabbit
    was euthanized due to excessive internal abscesses and cancer. One rabbit gave birth to
    five babies on October 20, and is doing well with three of the five babies available for
    adoption at the end of December (two have already been claimed for adoption). Upon closer
    examinations some interesting cases were found, including: a mummified baby attached to
    the uterus of rabbit; an old knee injury that resulted in osteoarthritis in the same
    rabbit; another had a mass in his right testicle and a scarred left testicle. Once all the
    rabbits are healthy, each will be placed into foster homes or adopted; and the next round
    of Hare Transplant Operation would begin pending negotiations with the park's businesses. </p>
    <p>Will the rabbits make good house buns? Yes. Feral rabbits are not wild. Most of the
    rescued rabbits<img SRC="whrndHE5.JPG" WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="163" align="right"> are
    dependent on being fed by people as they were in the business park. Many are unafraid of
    people and have very friendly dispositions. They will make excellent house buns with the
    help of foster care. </p>
    <p>HRS is desperate for volunteers and veterinarians to help care for the rescued rabbits.
    Money is needed to continue this operation. Foster homes are needed to help the rabbits
    adjust to their new homes. The 30-day commitment by volunteers of the two major companies
    ended on November 18. Fosterers and adopters are needed immediately. </p>
    <p><img SRC="whrndHE6.JPG" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="113" align="left">Fostering a rabbit
    entails taking one or two rabbit(s) into your home for about two to four weeks. We ask
    that you spend time with the rabbit on a one-to-one basis to get them used to the sounds
    and movements of our homes, and to let them know that being constantly petted, snuggled,
    kissed, and loved is a <u>good</u> thing. HRS will hold two <a href="foster%20class.htm">foster
    care classes</a> for those who wish to learn more about fostering. </p>
    <p>If you would like to help, please contact HRS, phone (425) 868-4839, and let us know!
    We need your help. We cannot do this alone. <br>
