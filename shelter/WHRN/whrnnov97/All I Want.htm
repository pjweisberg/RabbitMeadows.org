    align="right">MAX is a very cute, but very shy, Netherland Dwarf born approximately April
    of 1997. He arrived at HRS in poor condition with abcesses and no fur on his backside from
    fighting. His caretakers neglected to consider neutering two sexually mature male rabbits
    before putting them together. As a result, one rabbit died from fighting, while Max was
    rescued from the home. Today, Max is fully recovered from his injuries and has looks that
    would melt anyone's heart. Max loves large paper bags to play in. Caretakers that are very
    willing to spend time with him is best as he (very understandably) is still learning to
    trust people.&nbsp; <p><img SRC="WHRNDH15.JPG" WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="120" align="left">PEPPER
    is a darling little girl with a craving for lots of affection. She always in the front of
    her cage at the HRS Adoption Center just waiting for someone to give pets and kisses.
    Pepper will make a great companion for another house bun. She's very curious and will
    greet anyone indiscriminantly with lots of affection. Pepper was born approximately
    January of 1996. </p>

    <p><img SRC="WHRNDH16.JPG" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="108" align="right">BEA is a large French
    Lop whose size shouldn't intimidate you, she's actually a big silly sweetie. She will sit
    for as long as you can pet her (which could be a very long time). Bea is from the Seattle
    Animal Control, and was born approximately July of 1996</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img SRC="WHRNDH17.JPG" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="100" align="left">BLIZZARD AND HAILEY are
    beautiful White New Zealands. They're a bit shy, but with time, they are slowly becoming
    used to people. They were born approximately in January of 1997 and rescued from the King
    County Animal control. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img SRC="WHRNDH20.JPG" WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="82" align="right">WILLIE, KIKI, and MINNIE,
    were rescued as feral babies. They were born on April 27, 1997. ANGELO (very right in
    picture) is a Hotot and was rescued from the King County Animal Control. All are loads of
    energy. A home with lots of room to run around is most ideal for each.</td>
