					<h3><b><u>Project Overview</u></b></h3>
<p>Our 4 ½ acres are nicely wooded with numerous beautiful fir trees. Our plans are to leave all of these trees standing. There is an owl who (whooo) lives on the property, numerous Cottontails, and a family of raccoons. Every other year there are deer who feel safe enough on our property to give birth and raise their young until they are old enough to leave. We intend to maintain the property for our wild neighbors and to blend in our Shelter and Sanctuary to the environment. To accomplish this we will put up numerous small buildings to form “villages.”
<ul>
<li>Four adoption buildings
<li>Welcome & Administration building
<li>Education/class building
<li>Veterinary Clinic (low cost spay/neuters)
<li>Squirrel/cottontail rehab (under direction of USDA licensed Sara’s Sanctuary)
<li>Caretaker Cottage
<li>Summer Volunteer Cottage
<li>Three Feral Rabbit shelters
<li>One Permanent rabbit resident building
</ul>

<h3><b><u>Progress</u></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>We have received Critical Areas Designation (CAD ) approval from King County Dept of Development and Environmental Services (DDES). This means that there are no wetlands on the property and we have approval to build.
<li>We have an approved Septic System Design from Seattle/King County Dept. of Health
</ul>

<h3><b><u>Building Plans</u></b></h3>
<ol>
<li>Clear the brush and small alder trees. (Equipment can be rented for two days.) for driveway, buildings and paths.
<li>Install the Septic/Drain field System. This must be started prior to October 2009, or the permit will have to be extended. 
<li>Prepare foundations for 4 buildings (at a time) including water connections. Except for restroom facilities, “used” water will be  sent to a holding tank to be filtered and recycled for laundry and outdoor watering.
<li>The buildings are designed so that contractors can prefab them at their own site. 
<li>For each building, the prefab walls, floor and roof will be brought to Rabbit Meadows for an old fashioned “barn raising.” One building can be put up by several volunteers (being supervised by one building expert) in less than a day.
   The buildings are designed to take advantage of Natural Convective Heat & Cooling Transfer. In addition to this natural system, the heat generated by the animals living in each building will eliminate the current expensive electric bills each winter.
<li>Once a building is up, the wiring, plumbing and [easily cleanable] walls will be installed.
</ol>
