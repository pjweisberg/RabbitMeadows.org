	<p> Our <b>retail store</b> will stay in it's Seattle Lake City Way location so convenient for our customers, but we will be moving most
	of the animals out, operating the store out of just the front of the building.  This saves us money as well as providing a wonderful 
	new environment for our shelter animals and for our adopters.

	<p>
	<FONT COLOR="darkblue" size="5"><b> THE MOVE!</B></font>
	<p>Although the store will remain in Seattle, we will be moving the Adoption Center to <a href ="Rabbitmeadowssanctuary.asp"><u>Rabbit Meadows Santuary </u></a>in Redmond.  This beautiful 4 1/2 acre property belongs to BLRRFH (and the bank)
	and has been home to the hundreds of feral rabbits we have rescued over the last ten years.<p>

	The property is only seven miles out of Redmond and has recently been rezoned to allow us to have a shelter and adoption center
	there.  Previously, King County zoning restrictions would not allow us to have the shelter there (because of the increased traffic) and so this
	wasn't an option.  Now, we will be able to have both the sanctuary and the shelter in one location!<p>

	<P>

	<FONT COLOR="darkblue" size="5"><b>OUR FUTURE!</B></font>
	<p>

	We plan to soon build a shelter (no dogs or cats) with appropriate sized housing with lots of things to entertain our temporary
	and permanent critters, a veterinary clinic to allow us to spay/nueter our own animals, an education room, and many
	other things that we dream of.<p>

	<FONT COLOR="darkblue" size="5"><b>GET INVOLVED!</b></font><P>
	We will be working at Rabbit Meadows every Sunday and
	 most Saturdays until all the animals our moved. If you can volunteer in any way, please contact Sandi at 
	 <a href="mailto:sandi@rabbitrodentferret.org">Sandi@RabbitRodentFerret.org</a>.  Below are some specific skills we could use:

	<p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3"> <B>Carpentry Skills and Supplies</B> </font> 
	
	<p>We are converting the mobile home on the property to a temporary animal shelter.  During the month of December we will be building
	enclosures inside the closets.  We need lumber, screws, nails, cage wire and hardware, as well as people with carpentry skills.

	<p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3"> <B>Electrical Skills and Supplies</B></font>
	<p> We will be putting up outdoor lighting and need people with electrician skills.

	<p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3"> <B>Plumbing Skills and Supplies</B> </font> <p>
	
	We need to purchase and install a water holding tank due for our increased use of water for the animals and laundry (we are on
	 a private well).  We need the water tank, plumbing supplies, and people with plumbing skills.

	 We need a utility sink, washer and dryer, and to install them where the kitchen sink and stove currently are.

	 <p><p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3">

	 If you can't volunteer time, any <a href="donate.asp">donations</a> to help us with this move and with our ongoing rescue efforts would be much appreciated.
