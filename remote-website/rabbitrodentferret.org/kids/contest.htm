<p align="left">But then I think that there is a girl that comes in and takes
him from the<br>
shelter. The girl gives him to hay and oats to eat and plays with him. Even if
he's not<br>
young, and cuter like he used to be. So he can once again enjoy the rest<br>
of the easter holidays and he is never forgotten again!</p>

<p align="left">Until one rueful, colorless day,<br>
I sat despairing, sadly staring<br>
as someone opened the door<br>
Of my cage.<br>
<br>
<br>
I lifted my head out of this poor, deserted place,<br>
As I peered into a small girl's brightly hopeful face.<br>
Then suddenly, my spirits rose, hoping I&nbsp; soon would leave<br>
This dusty, dirty, cage.<br>
<br>
I stood staight and tall, bright and proud,<br>
at being given a second chance.<br>
I pointed my ears toward the ceiling,and hoped to look appealing<br>
As she lifted me out<br>
of my cage<br>
<br>
She affectionatly smoothed my tangled fur,<br>
But then her father scolded her:<br>
&quot;Put it back, we don't want that old, dirty animal!&quot;<br>
But she refused to put me in my cage.<br>
<br>
The memories of my first life flooded back, and a tear wound a track<br>
Down my quivering face.<br>
I didn't want to go thru it again, I'd rather stay here,<br>
In my cage.<br>
<br>
But, her warm touch and gentle smile<br>
Made trusting her worth while.<br>
I somehow knew that this time would be different,<br>
In my new cage.<br>
<br>
And though I knew they would be my last,<br>
These new days could replace the past.<br>
I left in peace, happier than ever, as my companion, my friend, sat beside<br>
My cage.<br>

<p align="left">Barking dogs and mewing cats<br>
Everywhere an abandoned pet is dying<br>
Hungry and sick I just sit crying<br>
In my cage<br>
<br>
There must be a chance somewhere<br>
Humans come to look and see<br>
I remember long ago when humans loved me<br>
In my cage<br>
<br>
A woman comes who really likes me<br>
She says she is a vet<br>
She brings me home, now I'm her pet<br>
In my cage<br>
<br>
She lets me out that day<br>
I sniff my surroundings cautiously<br>
This is where I want to be<br>
Out of my cage<br>
<br>
Then comes the sunny afternoon<br>
I meet a rabbit by the pond<br>
That very day we happily bond<br>
Out of my cage<br>
<br>
And we live together every day<br>
A lucky star I have found<br>
Everything around me is always safe and sound<br>
Out of my cage</p>

</p>
<p ALIGN="center">I'm thankful for the cuddles Maggie gives me.<br>
I'm thankful for Maggie's cute adorable face waiting for pets when I have to<br>
get up at some awful early hour.<br>
I'm thankful for Maggie's long hair that always needs brushing, for a place<br>
to just sit and be calm.<br>
I'm thankful for Maggie's silly uppy downy ears that always make me laugh.<br>
I'm thankful for Willow's bites, because they teach me to deal with the<br>
stuff life gives you.<br>
I'm thankful Willow is such a smart bun, because he always is up to<br>
something that makes me laugh.<br>
I'm thankful that Willow actually loves me, despite the fact I'm the<br>
&quot;meanie&quot; who grooms him, clips his claws, and all the awful stuff.<br>
I'm thankful Willow hated my psychology book, because it showed me I don't<br>
want to major in psychology.&nbsp; By the way, he doesn't hate my Guerilla Girls<br>
Women in Art book.....<br>
I'm thankful for Willow's ever destruction of magazines, since most of them<br>
are dumb anyways.<br>

</p>
<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thankful for my rabbit ''Speckels''
because she is my good luck<br>
bunny, whenever I have a test at school I always do good if she gives me<br>
kisses in the morning. I am thankful to have her, because she is my third bun<br>
and the other two had died within the first two weeks.&nbsp; I am thankful she
is so<br>
social because we have five other cats she has to put up with.&nbsp; I am also<br>
thankful she loves me as much as she does considering my brother and friends<br>
like to play rough with her. I am thankful she is so smart or she would get<br>
herself into alot of trouble! I am thankful to see her every morning with not<br>
only a wake-up call, but looking at me with happiness and gratitude.<br>
She puts up with alot and I love her from the tip of her puffy black tail to<br>
the end of her twitching black nose with the single white spot that drives me
crazy! -Kristina<br>
