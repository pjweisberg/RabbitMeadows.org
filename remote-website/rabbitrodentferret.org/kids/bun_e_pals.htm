<p ALIGN="left">Hi everyone:) My name is Zero. I have two rabbits. One is named
Big Bunny.<br>
He's a Chinchilla Rabbit. My other rabbit's name is Digger. She's a Dwarf<br>
Holland Lop. Digger has a cataract in both eyes. (It means she is blind.) I<br>
would really like to have a pen pal with a rabbit that is blind also. I'm a<br>
11 year old girl that has a big mouth according to my friends:)&nbsp;</p>
