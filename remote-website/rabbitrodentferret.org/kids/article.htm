<p ALIGN="left"><font FACE="Century Gothic" COLOR="Purple"></font>Most rabbits will need some type of housing, even if they are going to have the run of the owner's home. The majority of the rabbit cages that are available from pet stores and catalogs are too small for rabbits. Fortunately, many other choices are available.<br>
If your rabbit is not yet litter box trained, please check the House Rabbit Society's FAQ: Litter Training web page (<a HREF="http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/litter.html#cage">http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/litter.html#cage</a>) for information on this topic.<br>
An exercise pen is a good choice for a rabbit who is litter-box-trained. It is inexpensive, easy to set up, and can be easily moved. A pen at least three feet high is high enough to keep your rabbit from jumping over the sides. Another good choice is to make or buy a two-level condo. These condos have solid floors and the upper level is usually accessed by a ramp.<br>
A favorite with some rabbit owners is a condo made out of &quot;Neat Ideas Cubes&quot;. Instructions for making this type of condo can be found in the booklet mentioned below and on Kelly's Cage Pages (<a HREF="http://members.aol.com/pcfbunrab/cage2.html">http://members.aol.com/pcfbunrab/cage2.html</a>).<br>
You may want to get a copy of &quot;House Rabbit Habitats&quot; by the House Rabbit Society (<a HREF="http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-5/habitat-brochure.html">http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-5/habitat-brochure.html</a>). The booklet contains photos and plans for a variety of living arrangements people have created for their rabbits.<br>
When you set up your rabbit's housing, choose a place where your rabbit will not be isolated. A room where you spend much time would be ideal. After your cage is set up, you will need to add a litter box, heavy food bowls, and a water bottle or bowl. A piece of synthetic sheepskin may be added for your rabbit to sit on. An untreated willow basket and piece of wood should keep your rabbit from becoming bored.<br>
Keep in mind that no matter how large your rabbit house is or how many rabbit toys are available, you will need to interact with your rabbit on a regular basis. Rabbits need supervised free run time for exercise, mental stimulation, and socialization. Rabbits love to chew and they can be quite destructive. Make sure that the area that you choose to let your rabbit run free in is rabbit-proofed.<br>
A final reminder, don't forget to keep your rabbit's housing clean and to provide fresh water and food daily. Most important of all, don't forget to have fun with your rabbit. Your rabbit's daily free run time is the perfect time to pet and groom your rabbit. Some rabbits love to run around the room and jump and twist in the air. Enjoy, for that is one sign that your rabbit is happy and healthy!</p>
