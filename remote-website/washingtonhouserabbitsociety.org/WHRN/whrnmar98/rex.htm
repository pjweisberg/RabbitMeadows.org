    <p align="center">Mr. Rex was rescued by the Washington HRS at one year-old in December of
    1991. He was found positive for Tyzzers Disease, E. Cunnicula, and Pasteurella (yes, all
    three diseases). Although Mr. Rex has showed no symptoms ever, he was predicted to succumb
    to one or all of those diseases.</p>
    <p align="center">HRS volunteer, Kathy Renzo adopted Mr. Rex to live out what was supposed
    to be a short life.</p>
    <p align="center">Speed ahead to 1998, and we are ecstatic to present Mr. Rex at 8
    years-old (pictured below) and living a good life with his companion Missy Lou, and two
    puppy companions Kuma, and Harley! He continues to live with the diseases, without any
    symptoms. In addition, Mr. Rex and his family have accumulated travel miles including his
    latest trip that took him on a nine day cross-country ride in a motor home to his new home
    in Rhode Island.</p>
    <p align="center">Long live Mr. Rex! We wish you many more years to come.<br>
