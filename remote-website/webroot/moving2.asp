This month we have completely torn apart the old kitchen and created a Utility Room!<p>
 
We have a washer/dryer where the oven/counter used to be. <br>
We have a utility sink where the kitchen sink used to be. <br>
The dish cupboard has lost its shelves and has become the storage area for bunny towels & rugs.<p> 
 
The next most daunting project is to actually tap into the sink water lines to get water to the washing machine. The drains ready to go. (Why do I picture bunnies trying to swim across the adoption room floor.) If there are any plumbers who could tackle that project for us, the non-swimming rabbits would appreciate it!

	<FONT COLOR="darkblue" size="5"><b> THE MOVE</B></font>
	<p>Although the store will remain in Seattle, we will be moving the Adoption Center to <a href ="Rabbitmeadowssanctuary.asp"><u>Rabbit Meadows Sanctuary </u></a>in Redmond.  This beautiful 4 1/2 acre property belongs to BLRRFH (and the bank)
	and has been home to the hundreds of feral rabbits we have rescued over the last ten years.<p>

	The property is only seven miles out of Redmond and has recently been rezoned to allow us to have a shelter and adoption center
	there.  Previously, King County zoning restrictions would not allow us to have the shelter there (because of the increased traffic) and so this
	wasn't an option.  Now, we will be able to have both the sanctuary and the shelter in one location!<p>

	<P>

	<FONT COLOR="darkblue" size="5"><b>OUR FUTURE</B></font>
	<p>

	We plan to soon build a shelter (no dogs or cats) with appropriate sized housing with lots of things to entertain our temporary
	and permanent critters, a veterinary clinic to allow us to spay/nueter our own animals, an education room, and many
	other things that we dream of.<p>

	<FONT COLOR="darkblue" size="5"><b>GET INVOLVED!</b></font><P>
	We have almost accomplished the move thanks to all the wonderful volunteers who worked so hard to pull this off.  There is still
	a great need for volunteers for a variety of positions, inluding caring and feeding the animals at the sanctuary, helping out in the retail 
	store, and helping out with the web site and newsletter, and coordinatin volunteers. <p>
	
	If you can volunteer in any way, please contact Sandi at 
	 <a href="mailto:sandi@rabbitrodentferret.org">Sandi@RabbitRodentFerret.org</a>.  
	 
	We still need these specific skills for the ongoing construction in Redmond:

	<p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3"> <B>Carpentry Skills and Supplies</B> </font> 
	
	<p>We are converting the mobile home on the property to a temporary animal shelter.  During the month of December we will be building
	enclosures inside the closets.  We need lumber, screws, nails, cage wire and hardware, as well as people with carpentry skills.

	<p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3"> <B>Electrical Skills and Supplies</B></font>
	<p> We will be putting up outdoor lighting and need people with electrician skills.

	<p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3"> <B>Plumbing Skills and Supplies</B> </font> <p>
	
	We need to purchase and install a water holding tank (due to our increased use of water for the animals and laundry.) We are on
	 a private well.  We need the water tank, plumbing supplies, and people with plumbing skills.

	  And we need the following removed: kitchen sink, counter w/drawers and stove. And then we'll be able to install: a utility sink, washer and dryer.

	 <p><p><img src="reddot.gif" width="15" height="14"><font size="3">

	 If you can't volunteer your time, please consider making a 2007 tax-deductible <a href="donate.asp">donation</a> to help us with this move, and with our ongoing rescue efforts.
