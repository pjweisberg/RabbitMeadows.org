    <font SIZE="3"><p>Stanley and I have had a busy few months but we have a few free ear
    twitches to stretch out my hoppers and say hello. In November (that&#146;s when it&#146;s
    dark outside most of the time) Nancy and Uncle Leo took us to Whistler. They take us there
    two times a year and although Stan and I remember the place, we are worried about <u>their</u>
    memories. Whenever we arrive, they look out the window saying &quot;look at the
    mountain!&quot; We hop over and all we see is the same old mountain in the same old place.</p>
    <p>Stanley and I do have something new in our lives that is much more exciting than
    Whistler and mountains. Nancy calls them yams, sweet potatoes, and rutabagas. At 9 years
    old I thought I'd worked my way through all produce known to man and bunnies, but these
    three new ones are yummy. Have your human treat you to these tasty munchies...a slice or
    two will really perk you up. Uncle Leo thinks the way we eat should make us live forever.
    Stan and I thought that sounded great until we realized we&#146;d outlive Nancy and Uncle
    Leo. Don&#146;t tell them or they might get a little too cocky, but we&#146;d really miss
    them.</p>
    <p>Before I say ciao&#151;I prefer to spell it &quot;chow&quot;&#151;let me tell you about
    my wonderful Christmas present. I used to have trouble getting in and out of litter boxes,
    but Nancy solved my problem with the help of the <i>Best Little Rabbit Rodent and Ferret
    House,</i> on Lake City Way NE. They sold Nancy a litter box with one low side. Now my
    hoppers don&#146;t have any trouble at all. I let Stan use it too, but at times he sits in
    there too long and I have to remind him the slinky toy was <u>his</u> Christmas present,
    the beautiful litter box is <u>mine</u>.</p>
    <p>We did get to take our presents on our year-end trip to San Juan Island. New
    Year&#146;s eve is Nancy&#146;s birthday so Uncle Leo, Stan, and I worked really hard to
    make it a special day. I don&#146;t know what Uncle Leo did, but we were extra cute and
    let Nancy kiss, hug, and squeeze and tickle our tummies all day long. She laughed and
    smiled a lot so I think we succeeded. Stan and I tried to stay up until midnight to
    welcome in 1998, but our ears drooped early. I don&#146;t know about Uncle Leo&#146;s
    ears.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="3"><p>When we finally headed home we overheard Nancy and Uncle Leo talking
    about a movie they&#146;s seen called &quot;Titanic.&quot; Needless to say, Stanley and I
    breathed a sigh of relief when we got off the ferry!!</p>
    <p>Bye for now and we hope everyone&#151;bunnies and their humans&#151;have a
    yam-crunching, carrot-juice-dripping, hay-munching 1998!!</p>
    <p>Ear rubs,<br>
    Gus (with some help from my little Stanley buddy) </font></td>
