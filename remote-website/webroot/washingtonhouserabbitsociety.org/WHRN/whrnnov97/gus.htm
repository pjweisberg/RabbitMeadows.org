<h2><font size="3">Dear House Bunnies, </font></h2>

<p>Stanley and I had such a busy and fun summer. The bestest of all was the July bunny
picnic. We wiggled our noses so much that they wouldn't wiggle again for two whole days!!
We hope next year more of our fuzzy friends will be there, especially girl buns. The
biggest thrill for me was hearing several people tell me I looked thinner&#151;I even
heard the word &quot;svelte&quot; used to describe <u>me</u>! I know my diet and exercise
makes me feel better, but I guess I look better too. I was thinking of asking Santa Bunny
for a tummy tuck, but Stanley and I decided that was vain and would make me just another
pretty face with whiskers. Stanley came up with a great idea. He reminded me of an article
in the last newsletter about a rabbit sanctuary and together we decided to ask Santa Bunny
to make a donation in our name. That's a lot better than a tummy tuck! </p>

<p>Nancy recently returned from a trip to New England to visit her family. She didn't tell
us much about what they did, but we assume they groomed each other, shared treats, and
nuzzled noses. She let us stay at the Best Little Rabbit House Boarding Camp. Someday she
wants to take us up in the sky with her. She told us she needed details on how to fly with
bunnies. Stan and I have no idea what any of this means. If anybunny read this and has
been in what sounds to us like a gigantic flying hutch, please write us all about it. </p>

<p>Last weekend, Uncle Leo, Stanley, and I were watching a football game. Stan and I don't
really get it. Are the humans all blind? Is that why they run into each other? Are those
little balls so expensive they can't each have their own? It seems to us we should collect
money and buy each player his own ball so they don't have to spend several hours fighting
over one. Also, why can't they decide where they want the ball? We wanted to ask Uncle
Leo, but didn't want to ruin the atmosphere of male bonding. Don't tell Nancy, but Uncle
Leo gave each of us half a Dorito chip! We like male bonding!! Stanley wants to go to a
Promise Keepers' Convention. He thinks there must be lots of Doritos there. </p>

<p>Well, by for now. In my next letter I'll be writing about our trip to Whistler. We are
all going there in November. Stan and I know it'll be cold so we're busy growing fur. </p>

<p>Carrot crunches and hay munches, </p>

<p>Gus (&amp; Stanley) </p>

<p><i>Editor's note: HRS thanks Gus and Stanley for their very generous donation to the
Sanctuary fund Thank you Gus &amp; Stanley!!. </i></p>
