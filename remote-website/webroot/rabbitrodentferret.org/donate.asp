	Your donations keep us up and running at Rabbit Meadows!  So many animals have a second chance at a new life
	because of our generous donors.  We couldn't do it without you!<p>  
	We thought you might like to know what your money is used for here at the shelter, so here are some examples of what your donations do:
	<hr>
	
   <p><font size="3" color="#0000c0"> <B>Sponsor an animal in the name of a loved one or friend.</b></font>

   <p><img src="donategift.jpg" width="113" height="104" align="left" hspace="10">We will send a card to your loved one or friend telling them
   about your gift in their name.  Just let us know that person's name and address in the message section of the Pay-Pal form.  A personal message can be included.<br clear="all">

	
	<p><font size="3" color="#0000c0"> <B>Give hard-to-adopt animals like Mattie some time to be discovered by just the right person.</b></font>  
	<p><img src="mattie0002.jpg" width="170" height="110" align="right" hspace="10">Being large, white, and red-eyed guaranteed that
	it was going to take Mattie some time to find a home.  Most shelters do not have the space to keep hard-to-adopt animals alive for long. 
	Your money bought Mattie the months she needed to find her wonderful new home with the Christensens (who recognized that she's just perfect).

	<br clear=right><br><font size="3" color="#0000c0"> <B>Provide much needed food, housing and medical care, including spays and neuters.</B></font>
	<p><img src="vetad.jpg" width="88" height="81" align="left" hspace="10">Most of the animals that come to BLRRFH need to be spayed or neutered and many of them need extra special care.  Owners often
	abandon animals <I>because</I> they need veterinary care due to sickness, old age, or abuse.  We are their last chance.  Your donations help them get the 
	care and medical attention they need.



	<br clear=left><br><font size="3" color="#0000c0"> <B>Provide Sanctuary for rabbits who can't be adopted</b></font>
	<P><img src="onebunnysmall.jpg" width="84" height="122" align="right" hspace="10">Feral rabbits are not good candidates to be adopted as house rabbits.  Our <a href="/rabbitrodentferret.org/RabbitMeadowsSanctuary.asp">Sanctuary at Rabbit Meadows</a> is set up just for them, because we believe that all animals, regardless of temperament or affinity for humans, deserve to live out their lives free from fear, pain, hunger and emotional or physical suffering.  Although the rabbits live in a natural way, they must still be fed and have their medical needs taken care of, and your donations do just that. 

	<br clear=right><font size="3" color="#0000c0"> <B>Build a shelter, housing and play areas for the shelter and sanctuary rabbits.</b></font>
	<p><img src="outdoor.jpg" width="111" height="103" align="left" hspace="10">
	Now that we have accomplished the big move to our property in Redmond, we will start concentrating on making this the haven of our dreams!  We need more housing (the more housing we have the more animals we can save from shelters) and outdoor play areas, as well as a building for our main shelter (right now we are making do with the trailer that was on the property).<p><a href="RabbitMeadowsBrochure2.pdf"><u>View and/or print our brochure</u></a>
	
	<br clear="all">
	<ul>
	<li>$5,000 will build one 200 sq foot building. The
building will be named by you, and a plaque with
your personal inscription will be a permanent fixture.
(Ask your friends and family to participate with
you!)
<li> $2,500 -$4,999 You will be forever recognized
with your name and photo on a plaque in our
reception area.
<li> $1,000-$2,499 You will be forever recognized
with your name on a plaque in our reception area.
<li> $500 Your name or your companion animals name
on a brick in one of our paths.
<li> $ All amounts will help the
animals dreams come true.
In addition to the buildings we also need funding for:<ul>
<li> A drilled well (our current well is too shallow)
<li> A new septic system (our current system is
designed for a single family home and is not adequate for
a large number of visitors)
<li> Tractor (We will compost and sell bunny poop)
<li> Landscaping,: plants, etc.
<li> Riding lawn mower
<li> Veterinary clinic equipment
</ul>
</ul>

	<br clear=left><br>	<font size="3" color="#0000c0"> <B>Build an education center for current and potential adopters</b></font> 
<p><img src="Annette_2002.jpg" width="110" height="101" align="right" hspace="10">  We see this as a place where we can offer classes and education of all
	kinds for those wishing to learn how to better care for their companion animals.  It will also be a place from which we can educate the 
	general public about all rabbit, rodent and ferret related matters.

	<p>
	<font size="3" color="#0000c0"> <B>Build a vet clinic</b></font>
	<p><img src="Aaron_2003.jpg" width="96" height="103" align="left" hspace="10">We have many animals with medical needs at our shelter and sanctuary.  Some need emergency care.  Some need a one-time procedure to live a pain-free life.  Some need ongoing medication and care.  Our dream is to have our own vet clinic to expand the quality and quantity of the medical care we provide to the animals we rescue.
